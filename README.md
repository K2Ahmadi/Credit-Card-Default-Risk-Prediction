# Credit-Card-Default-Risk-Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether or not a client will default on their upcoming credit card payments. 

The dataset used for this project is the "default of credit card clients" dataset, which is comprised from payment data collected from a prestigious bank in Taiwan that issues currencies and credit-cards. The data, which was collected in October 2005, contains a diverse sample which includes different educational levels, marital status, a variety of different ages for both males and females. The dataset contains 30,000 observations, 23 features, and the target variable is the bankâ€™s credit-card holders default pattern (1 being yes and 0 being no).

The project is divided into three main stages:

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
 2. Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing
 3. Implementing, Tuning, Testing Machine learning Models
